We, humans, have a tendency to oversimplify the world surounding us. Although it is necessary because of the sheer amount of information we have to constantly analyze (see my [insight]({{ page.baseurl }}appearances-are-important) about this), it leads to many unfounded generalizations and flaws our thoughts and decision making process.

Developing the ability to see the world through statistics allows us to see things for what they realy are. We won't fall for common fallacies such as the fallacy of incomplete evidence or the anecdotal evidence fallacy. Furthermore, thinking in terms of statistics allows us to ask the right questions: what information are we truly missing to see the situation clearly?

In short, I think that developing our statistical mind is one of the best critical thinking tool and can greatly help us navigate our world overflowing with information and doubtful claims.
