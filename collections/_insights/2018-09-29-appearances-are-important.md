We often hear that appearances are not important. We should not judge a book by its cover right? Or should we? In a world where we are consistantly stimulated by an overwhelming amount of data, our minds do not have a choice but to aggregate and ignore some of it. Otherwise, we would simply go mad trying to analyse and make sense of all that information and stimuli. The consequence is that we judge based on limited information. We judge based on appearances. But wait, this is not a bad thing. It allows us to tell if a fruit is rotten without having to taste it. It allows us to steer clear of people who look sick just by looking at them. I concede that in some situations, we should make the conscious effort of stepping over those subconscious barriers. However, like I just mentioned, it requires effort. So why not put all the chances on our side and look good? Why not purposefully instill trust and assurance in others? Why not make their life easy by not requiring them do go jump over their natural defences in order to appreciate us? Appearances are important.
