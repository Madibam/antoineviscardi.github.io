title: Do Not Confuse Pragmatism With Dogmatism

While working on a learning unit of one of my course two sentences really struck me as important insights : "It's important to be pragmatic, not dogmatic, when choosing tools [...]. Sometimes 'quick and dirty' is just fine, because quick." It immediately made me think about a [post](https://fs.blog/2016/09/lee-kuan-yew-rule/){:target="_blank"} from one of my favorite blogs, [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/){:target="_blank"}. In the post, the reader is introduced to a simple idea from Lee Kuan Yew, one of my personal source of inpiration. Basically when it comes to applying theory or philosophy, we only really need to ask ourselves on simple question, "does it work?". That's it. It is that simple, but it is far from being meaningless. It embodies all the complexity and importance of the never ending tug of war between ideologies and practicalities. When it comes to dealing with real life situations, I do not think ideologies are necessarely bad, but I think they should be tested. We should always keep track of good success metrics and face the cold hard truth: does it work or not? In the end, that is the only thing that matters.
