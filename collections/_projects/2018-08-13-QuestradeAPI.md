QuestradeAPI is a Python wrapper for the [Questrade API][api].
I wrote this wrapper to help me develop applications requiring financial data and/or that could interact with my brockerage account.

The package is available on [GitHub][gh] and is uploaded on [Pypi][pypi]. Therefore, anyone can download my package using Pipenv (or Pip). This allows anyone with a Questrade account to manipulate their data with one of the most powerful and most used data anaylisis programming langage: Python.
