## 1. Studying for my master's
This is my second semester at UofT and I want to make sure I stay on top of my different courses.

## 2. Improving my piano
I had not touched a piano since I was 7. A couple months ago I decided to get back into it. I found a good teacher and I am highly motivated to learn.

## 3. Learning about focus
After reading [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1455586692/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_n6IwCbZ4Z2HP9){:target="\_blank"} from Call Newport I was shocked to realize how much our ability to work deeply and immerse ourselves in a task has deepleted in the recent years. I want to learn more on the workings of our attention mechanisms and how I can adjust my focusing habits.
