## 1. Finishing this website
I build this website on my own this summer and I kind of left it on the back burner for a while now. I would really like to finish polishing it up by the end of the month. More specifically, I want to focus on my about page and making sure it truly reflects who I am and what I believe in.

## 2. Studying for my master's
This is my second semester at UofT and I want to make sure I stay on top of my different courses.

## 3. Learning about landscape management
I really want to deepen my knowledge of how we can create sustainable systems that meet our different needs, as much environmental than social and economic. By the way, I recently read a [very good paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/21/8349){:target="_blank"} on the subject. 

## 4. Improving my piano
I had not touched a piano since I was 7. A couple months ago I decided to get back into it. I found a good teacher and I am highly motivated to learn.
