Hello! My name is Antoine Viscardi,

I finally got around to launch my website, something I wanted to do for a long time but never took the time to do. Actualy, the main *raison d'Ãªtre* of this website is to create a form of accountabilty by making my goals public and consistently sharing my progress on the various projects that I undertake.

Furthermore, not only do I want this website to act as my portfolio but I also want it to give a good idea of the kind of person I am, what defines my character and what makes me *tick*.
