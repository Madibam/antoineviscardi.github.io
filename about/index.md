## My Principles

### Integrity
Integrity means being true to yourself. This involves being aware of the principles you believe in and acting accordingly at all times. It also means being responsible for your actions and owning your mistakes. How can you grow as a person if you don't?

### Humility
Humility means not only to be aware of your own limits and flaws but also to acknowldege that you can always learn something from any situation or encounter.  It translates into respect for others and open-mindedness. 

### Focus
Focus represents our ability to deliberatly choose how we allocate our attention. It allows us to resist temptations and live purposefully. Without deliberate focus you cannot force yourself out of your comfort zone. It is at the origin of willpower, a keystone ability shown to be a better predictor of success than IQ.

### Connections
Creating connections widens possibilities. It allows for sharing knowledge and skills as well as integrating different abilities or ways of thinking into a cohesive whole. This results in much more diverse and resilient systems and communities where the deficiencies of an individual part are balanced by the strenghts of others.
