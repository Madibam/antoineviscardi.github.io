## My Principles
I believe that anyone who aspires to live a meaningful life should first start by identifying what he believes in. 

recognizing and labeling such core principles allows to constantly be connected to your true self. When in doubt, you can always fall back on what you know to be fundamentally true.

I first stumbled onto this idea while reading *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* from Stephen R. Covey when I was in my senior year of high school. It profoundly changed my life: I was now aware of my potential as a person and was able to broadly identify what I wanted my life to be all about. It gave me tools with which to assert my actions and identify the aspects of my character I had to work on. Ultimately it gave me a direction.

With that, here are the core principles I strive to live by.


### Integrity
Integrity means being true to yourself, not trying to be anyone else. It also means owning your actions. 

### Humility
You can always learn from others. Being humble allows you to stay open minded. It also means being able to accept that you might be wrong.

### Direction over Speed
Take the time to clearly identify what you want to achieve and how you will get there. If you are heading in the wrong direction, you are basically wasting your efforts.

### Knowledge
Understand the underlying conceptual models of concepts and how it relates to other concepts. Merely learning by hearth is futile as it does not allow me to employ the knowledge in a intricate problem solving context or simply learn new ones by building upon it. Acquiring mental models allows to leverage the broadness of your knowledge base.

### Creating Links
Creating links between people or communities fosters a sense of bealonging and purpose. It also results in the creation of opportunities and allows for a more important and meaningful impact on society.
