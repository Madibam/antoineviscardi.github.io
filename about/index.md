## My Principles
I believe that any man who wants to live a meaningful life should first start by identifying who he is, what he believes in. Identifying such core principles and holding them close in thought allows to constantly be connected to your true self. When in doubt, you can always fall back on what you know to be fundamentally true.

I first stumbled onto this idea while reading *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* from Stephen R. Covey when I was in my senior year of high school. It profoundly changed my life: I was now aware of my potential as a person and was able to broadly identify what I wanted my life to be all about. It gave me tool with which to assert my actions and identify the aspects of my character I had to work on. Ultimately it gave me a direction. How can one except to move forward in life without direction?

Recently, I started thinking about my core values and principles again. I found that, while some of them had not changed, I could not remember some others. At first I blamed myself for allowing my principles to be forgottend. However, I then realized that the progress I had made  over the last couple years had open my mind to new ideas and that my old principles had not diapered but complexified and evolved. 

With that, here are the core principles I live by.


### Integrity
Being true to yourself, not trying to be anyone else.
Owning your actions.
Admiting to your errors.


### Humility
You can always learn from others. Being humble allows you to stay open minded. It also means being able to accept that you might be wrong or that someone might have a better approach than yours.

### Direction over Speed
Take the time to clearly identify what you want to achieve and how you will get there. If you are heading in the wrong direction, you are basically wasting your efforts. 

### Genuienely understand, not simply learn.
Understand the underlying model (mental model, conceptpual model) of concepts and how it relates to other concepts. What is the underlying meaning? Merely learning by hearth is futile as it does not allow me to employ the knowledge in a intricate problem solving context or simply learn new ones by building upon it. 

Idea of '''mental models''' from Charlie Munger or '''coneptual models''' from Don Norman.

### Focus
