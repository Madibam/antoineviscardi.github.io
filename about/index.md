## My Principles
I believe that any man who wants to live a meaningful life should first start by identifying who he, what he believes in. Identifying such core principles and holding them close to you in thought allows you to constantly be connected to your true self. When in doubt, you can always fall back on what you know to be true and universally good.

I first stumbled onto this idea while reading *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* from Stephen R. Covey when I was in my senior year of high school. It profoundly changed my life: I was now aware of my potential as a person and was able to broadly identified what I wanted my life to be all about. It gave me tool with which to assert my actions and identified the aspects of my character I had to work on. Ultimately it gave me a direction. How can one except to move forward in life without direction. 

Recently, I started thinking about my core values and principles again. I found that, while some of them had not changes, I could not remember the details of others. At first I blamed myself for allowing my principles to be forgotten in the back of my mind. Then, after reflexion I realized that the progress I had made  over the last couple years had open my mind to new ideas and that my old principles had not diapered but complexified and evolved.
