title: QuestradeAPI

QuestradeAPI is a Python wrapper for the [Questrade API][api].
I wrote this wrapper to help me develop applications requiring financial data and/or that could interact with my brockerage account.

The package is available on [GitHub][gh] and is uploaded on [Pypi][pypi]. Therefore, anyone who has an account with Questrade can download my package using Pipenv (or pip). This allows them to manipulate their data with on of the most powerful and most used data anaylisis programming langage: Python.
